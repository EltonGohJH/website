**:fas-comment: My comments:**


Understandably, some of you prefer live lectures (F2F or online) -- one advantage of those modes is that
 you can ask questions immediately if something is unclear.<br>
**On-the-spot Q&A doesn't scale up to very large classes**, unfortunately --
 even if your question is relevant to half the class, it becomes a disruption to
 hundreds of other students, especially so for a module like ours
 in which the students' learning speed can vary a lot.<br>
Hence, our live lectures are online and limited to briefings only, while most content are delivered as text and
 prerecorded lectures which students can consume at their own pace.
 While I can still answer some questions at the end of the lecture, the rest needs to be asynchronous
 e.g., via pre email or the forum.<br>
 On the positive side,
 we follow multiple topic threads every week, which means you can continue learning other topic
 threads while waiting for an answer. Also, the topics are not that deep/complex
 -- the chance of getting stuck is lower.<br>
 So, I hope you guys are able to manage even if I don't do live lectures covering all content.<br>
 As for F2F lectures, it is out of the question right now due to COVID rules, and might not be possible
 even after, due to the lack of venues that can support such a big class size :-(

Glad to see pre-recorded videos are generally well-received.
Nevertheless, I hope to add more and also improve the existing ones in future semesters.

You can skip lecture briefings if you think they are not useful, or simply speed-watch the
 recording later. Even the in-lecture quiz questions are 'optional' in the sense they are unlikely to make a
 difference in your final participation marks.<br>
 :fas-exclamation: Note: Totally ignoring the lecture briefings will exclude you from future CS2103/T tutor positions
 though, as I do not want to employ as a tutor someone who hasn't received the _full view_ of the module
 (I often talk about the goals/rationales of the module during lecture briefings
 -- not examinable but important nevertheless, especially for a future tutor).

**:fas-comment: My comments:**


Admittedly, our tutorials can feel slow, less efficient, or less active. If you are the type of student
  that prepare well for the tutorials and actively take part in tutorial discussions, this is indeed the case.
  I hope you still bear with us because ==the tutorial structure (like many other things in this module)
  is intended to _raise the lower bar of the whole class_, which is important when there is a major team project
  (to reduce the skill gap between team members)==. 
  * **We start with a 10-minute warm up** to give everyone at least a chance to familiarize with the tutorial tasks
    even if they haven't had time to look at them earlier (we don't want them to be left out totally).
  * **By requiring _everyone_ to respond via private messages**, we aim to get everyone to _think_ about the topic
    at hand and attempt to answer without being biased by others’ answers.
    As I mentioned in a previous lecture, pedagogy research has shown that this act of thinking/attempting
    before receiving the correct answer increases the effectiveness of learning,
    even if you get the answer wrong at first.<br>
    That said, we do want to have some verbal discussions to happen too. That's why we ask you to do the follow up
    discussions verbally.
  * **We monitor tutorial participation** because tutorials are used for ensuring that you all have achieved the desired
    learning targets for the week. If not, slower students tend to neglect the theory part 
    (in a misguided attempt to save time) and try to brute-force the project work, which wastes even more time,
    and also exacerbates the skill-gap problems in their teams.
  * So, while the number of questions we go through in each tutorial is fewer and the questions are simpler,
    _getting everyone to answer almost every question on the spot_ (this is different from answering a quiz _at your own
    convenience_, which we already do anyway) has ==a higher total learning gain for the entire class==.<br>
    So, if you are one of the
    stronger students getting less out of our tutorials than you are used to get from other modules, I hope
    you'll be generous and take a 'hit' here to allow your classmates to level up. You might even benefit yourself
    from their levelled-up contributions when you work with them in the team project.

The feedback for the module website is generally positive but some areas to improve have been mentioned.
  Thanks for bringing those up. I will continue to try and improve the website whenever I can.<br>
  In the meantime, I thank you for your patience with the website -- it's not easy to disseminate that much
  of information in a way that fits everyone's expectations %%(e.g., some prefer more content to be more 'visual'
  while others prefer minimalistic presentation)%%,
  and I realize that ==it is not easy for you to consume that much of information== either.

**:fas-comment: My comments:**


The most common concern about this module is the workload.
  I’m afraid it is not going to get any lower in the second half :-(.
  Some suggestions:
  * If you are already struggling with the iP workload, don’t be too ambitious with the tP.
    In particular, choose the ‘evolve’ option rather than ‘morph’ option (it’s still not too late to change).
    If you choose the ‘morph’ option, don’t plan to morph it too far away from AB3.<br>
    Reminder: there are no marks allocated for marking the product interesting, unique, cool, etc.<br>
    Also, keep in mind that it is the quality that will count more than the quantity. 
    In most cases the quantity is graded on an S/U basis (refer to the Week 6 tP briefing for more info).
    Aim to do less but do it really well.
  * If you don't have time to study all topics, use the 
    [star ratings system](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s1.github.io/website/admin/moduleExpectations.html#star-rating-system)
    to figure out which topics are higher priority.
  * That said, I know the workload concern is real, and I firmly believe that no module should take more than
    its fair share of students' time. On the other hand, this module aims to teach you SE skills that take a lot
    of practice (hence the high workload).<br>
    We've managed to reduce the workload of this module quite bit over the past semesters, and we'll continue to
    do so when we find ways to do that without compromising our learning outcomes.

**:fas-comment: My comments:**


The pace itself seems to be less of a problem compared to the workload.<br>
Don't worry if you feel like the module is moving too fast; thanks to the iterative approach we use for covering topics,
 you'll get multiple chances to solidify your familiarity of a topic/tool.

<p>The javafx tutorial felt very barebones and poorly done; implementing javafx also made a large amount of the previously implemented code redundant. It feels very unnecessarily shoe horned in and my opinion is the course would be better without it.

<p>I don't get why the week for CS2103T starts on Friday rather than Monday. I don't know about others, but I personally think that releasing new weekly tasks to do on Friday is quite inconsiderate. If we want to spend our weekends with friends and family, it is hard to enjoy ourselves when we know we have uncompleted tasks to do such as watching the pre-recorded videos and doing our week's requirements for the IP that have the deadline on Thursdays. If the weekly tasks were to start on Monday instead, we could at least try to complete the work on weekdays and then enjoy the weekend knowing that we have finished all our tasks for this week. 
I think there is a reason that the school week for NUS and every other school in Singapore starts on Monday and end on Friday. Why the need to reinvent it?</p>
<p><box type="info" icon=":fas-comment:" light><span class="text-info">That's a fair point. It's unfortunate that our lecture is scheduled on Friday. I suspect I'll get many complaints if I do the lecture on Friday but withhold the weekly tasks until the following Monday :-(

I understand this is to differentiate more important information from less important ones, but I just feel it's a bit too "colorful". Maybe it's just me but I do prefer more minimalist and concise content.</p>

<p>I think it would be better if the deadlines for ip and tp be on a Friday (give us one week worth of time) instead of the day before tutorials as the amount of time required to fulfil those tasks can be quite time-consuming (assuming we want to do more than the bare minimum)</p>
<p><box type="info" icon=":fas-comment:" light><span class="text-info">It is <em>better</em> if you do the weekly project tasks before the tutorial (as some tutorial tasks are designed to reinforce what you learned from the weekly project tasks) but the hard deadline is Friday for everyone e.g., you can do a minimal version before the tutorial and do some more work in the remaining days.

<p>Having completed Orbital at Artemis level, a lot of things that I have self-learnt during the summer has been covered again in the first few weeks of CS2103T and I feel that I have learnt nothing new, except for the UML diagrams. It gets to a point where it is really boring for me and I have no interest in doing something similar (iP) where I have done something of a much bigger scale in Orbital. Perhaps, those who completed artemis level could be exempted from the iP.</p>
<p><box type="info" icon=":fas-comment:" light><span class="text-info">Yes, the iP can be less useful to more experienced students like yourself. A few semesters ago, we did a pilot of letting more experienced students opt out of iP. The rule was, they get full marks for the iP if they manage to score at least half the marks for the tP (a very low bar); if not, the iP will be given the same score percentage as the tP. Only two students took that option, and both scored less than half for the tP, thus losing the opportunity to score full marks for the iP. Both explicitly stated that not doing the iP slowed them down in the tP. I suspect students who actually could have used the opt-out successfully played it safe and did the iP anyway while the two who took the option overestimated how much they knew. So, I decided not to continue that opt-out scheme. Even if we officially tie the opt-out option to Orbital performance, we can't guarantee that the student has achieved the iP learning outcomes via Orbital because Orbital is by-design not meant to cover those learning outcomes. On the positive side, if a student actually knows the iP stuff already, s/he should be able to do the iP with less effort, albeit being a bit bored with it, like you are :-p

<p>The only issues I have is with the module website. </p>
<p>There's so much to read and there's also videos to watch. There's so many drop downs it's crazy and almost feels like I'm stuck in an infinite recursion loop of things to read hahahhaa send help please. </p>
<p>I'm using this firefox plugin called video speed controller, wonder if you can make panopto work with it. It works with zoom videos, youtube videos, and luminus videos but for some reason doesn't work with the embedded videos and I can't go above 2x speed. It would be great if the in video quizzes have the full question in them. I often miss out the question because I'm speeding up the video speed.</p>
<p>I don't know why but I read extremely slowly and I would appreciate a text to speech feature on the website that can be sped up (don't know how it's going to work with all the dropdowns).</p>
<p>That said, I love this module and Prof Damith &lt;3. He's a very direct and practical guy. I love his rationale behind his teachings rather than the usual shove it down your throat methodology by other profs. I'm just facing issues reading the materials because it just feels all over the place (due to the deeply embedded drop downs) despite it literally being on one webpage. Maybe I just have issues reading text to be honest. However, I'm still going to be a better student and software engineer after reading the materials and speed hearing the content may not be the best for retention after all uwu.</p>

<p>Please allow tutors to share the slides after tutorials to avoid students wasting time trying to screenshot the slides. From our experience, because of the fact that the slides are not shared, we end up potentially missing out on important information the tutor is trying to convey while we are trying to take notes and screenshot the slides.</p>
<p>Why not do pre-recorded lectures as well? Since the point is mainly to go through the bonus quiz questions. While students are able to ask questions live during the live lectures, questions asked during the live lecture would also slow down the pace significantly, making it less effective for students who don't find the questions asked relevant to them. Instead, it seems better to use existing channels of communication for Q&amp;A with students, so that the live lecture slot could be used for more urgent questions/technical help students might require, or even be removed completely.</p>
<p>Tutorials could also be made optional if the content only consists of quiz questions with no verbal discussion. If the same outcome can be accomplished without attending a live online tutorial, it seems better to not have the online tutorial so that students can better spend that time elsewhere (having their TP meeting, catching up on sleep/other modules) while still achieving the learning outcomes of the weekly tutorial at their own pace. </p>
<p>For instance, Week 4's tutorial was simply posting screenshots of our Duke program and typing some answers into the chat related to UML diagram interpretations. An alternative way to conduct this tutorial would be to disseminate the instructions on what and where to upload our screenshots, and a Luminus quiz could be set up to ask the same questions and allow students to type submit their textual responses. (same as on Zoom but students would also be able to keep a copy of their responses for revision). </p>
<p>Another alternative would be to think of ways to allow for more discussion or communication during tutorials, but that would require more thought and planning which might not be ideal at this point in the semester. </p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
<p><box type="info" icon=":fas-comment:" light><span class="text-info">Not having a copy of the slides can indeed be irritating, but if all go as intended, you will not need to refer to tutorials slides later. Those learning points covered in tutorials will come up repeatedly during the semester and you are likely to remember them well enough by the exam. <br><br>All lecture are recorded. Instead of attending the lecture, you can wait a few more hours and watch the video, which is not that different from pre-recording the lecture.<br><br>We try to have both chat and verbal interactions during tutorials.

<box type="info" header="++My general responses for points raised multiple times++"
 icon=":fas-comment:" icon-size="2x" light >

Given below are some general responses to points you guys raised multiple times above:

* **Why not start tP earlier?**: This too relates to the skill-gap problem mentioned above. We need time to raise
  the lower bar of the skills in the class so that the skill gap between team members can be smaller.<br>
  Even if your team is not affected by the skill gap issue, as mentioned in the most recent lecture,
  the project is simply a sandbox to practice using various tools/techniques -- which means we have to wait till we
  had time to learn those tools/techniques before practicing them in the project. To give an example, you could have
  started the project early and used the code itself to understand the current AB3 design -- but because we waited
  till we learned how to interpret UML diagrams, we now have a chance to practice using UML diagrams to understand 
  a new code base.
* **JavaFX** (and the tech stack) While JavaFX is the de-facto UI technology for Java desktop apps,
  the chances of you using it in future is low, given most Java work tend to be back-end/server-side.
  Hence, it's fine if you are not very comfortable with JavaFX -- the tP/iP can be done without an in-depth
  knowledge of it.<br>
  At the same time, it is good to get _some_ exposure to a GUI framework too.
  While JavaFX is not the best GUI framework, it has some similarities with GUI frameworks, and knowing it might help
  you if you had to use one such GUI framework in future. 
* **Working on weekends**: I realize that having to work on the weekend is not ideal.
  In our case it feels even worse because our lecture 
  is on Friday and the tasks for the next week are released on Friday as a result. In theory, it is possible to
  not work on weekends nevertheless; but in practice, I can't imagine the typical SoC workload can be done
  without working through at least _some_ part of the weekend. It is one of the sacrifices one has to make to be in
  an in-demand field such as CS.<br>
  If it makes you feel better, I can't even remember the last time I did not have to work through the weekend :-(
