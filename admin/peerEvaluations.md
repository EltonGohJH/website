This module leverages peer feedback/evaluations in many ways. In particular, we do several rounds of peer evaluations using TEAMMATES.

* **Dependability**: Promises what can be done, and delivers what was promised.
* **Effort**: Puts in sufficient effort to, and tries their best to keep up with the module/project pace. Seeks help from others when necessary.
* **Quality**: Does not deliver work products that seem to be below the student's competence level i.e. tries their best to make the work product as high quality as possible within her competency level.
* **Meticulousness**:

#### Guidelines for Giving Peer Feedback

Giving constructive feedback to others is a valuable skill for software engineers. It is also an intended learning outcome of this module. Half-hearted/trivial feedback will not earn participation marks.

Here are some things to keep in mind:

* Assume you are giving feedback to a colleague, not a friend. Keep the tone of your feedback reasonably professional. Do not use offensive language or slang.
* The feedback should be honest and consistent. Giving positive qualitative feedback (e.g. `Thanks for all the hard work!` and negative ratings (e.g. `Equal share - 40%`) to the same team member is not being honest.
* State your expectations early. All too often students give positive/neutral feedback early (hoping that the team member will improve later) and trash the team member in the final evaluation (because the he/she did not improve as expected). However, this could be confusing to the recipient. It is better to give negative feedback early so that the team member gets a clear signal that he/she needs to improve.
