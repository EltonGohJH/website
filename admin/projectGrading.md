Scale: [`U`: Unable to judge][`L`: Low, B- and below][`M`: Medium, B+/A-][`H`: High, A/A+]

**Difficulty/Depth**:
- ( ) `L`: %%e.g., 1. make the existing _find_ command case insensitive%% <br>
      %%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. CRUD for a simple entity type just like Person 
      that is not connected to any other entity type%%

      %%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. a new entity type moderately different from Person and 
      lightly connected to other entity types%%.
- ( ) `H`: %%e.g., a) A high-level of natural language support b) A deep integration with another product c)
       An enhancement that makes the product good enough to take to the market d) A new entity type very different from
       Person and deeply connected to many other entity types%%

**Completeness**:
- ( ) `L`: A partial implementation of the feature. Barely useful.
- ( ) `M`: The feature has enough functionality to be useful for some of the users.
- ( ) `H`: The feature has all functionality to be useful to almost all users 
      AND Some optimization for keyboard users e.g., easy-to-type syntax.

**Other**: `polished`: The feature looks _polished_ i.e., A/A+.

**Difficulty/Depth**:
- ( ) `L`: %%e.g., 1. make the existing _find_ command case insensitive%% <br>
      %%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. CRUD for a simple entity type just like Person

      %%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. a new entity type moderately different from Person and 
      lightly connected to other entity types%%.
- ( ) `H`: %%e.g., a) A high-level of natural language support b) A deep integration with another product c)

**Completeness**:
- ( ) `L`: A partial implementation of the feature. Barely useful.
- ( ) `M`: The feature has enough functionality to be useful for some of the users.
- ( ) `H`: The feature has all functionality to be useful to almost all users 
      AND Some optimization for keyboard users e.g., easy-to-type syntax.

**Other**: `polished`: The feature looks _polished_ i.e., A/A+.
