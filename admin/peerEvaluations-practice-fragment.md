### Session: `Prelim Peer Evaluation`

* Objective: to give you a chance to familiarize with the TEAMMATES tool, to see in advance the type feedback that you will give/receive later in the semester.
* Held early in the semester.
* Submission is compulsory. However, ==ratings/responses you receive will not be considered for grading== .
* Although this is for early in the project, we recommend that you ==give sincere/accurate feedback== to others as much as possible so as not to waste this round of peer evaluations.
* The questions in this session are similar to the `Midterm Peer Evaluation`, but has the following additional question:<br>
  **{{ icon_green_Q }} How much do you plan to contribute to the team project?**<br>
  * An equal share<br>
  * A bit more than an equal share<br>
  * A lot more than an equal share<br>
  * A bit less than an equal share (e.g., due to other commitments)<br>
  * A lot less than an equal share<br>
  * Can only do the bare minimum to pass
