{{ icon_example }} Some examples:
* Alicia earned 1/2, 3/5, ++2/5++, 5/5, 5/5, 5/5, 5/5, 5/5, 5/5, 5/5, 4/5, 5/5 in the first 12 weeks. As she received at least half points in 11 of the weeks, she gets 5 participation marks. The bonus mark is not applicable as she has full marks already.
* Benjamin managed to get at least half of the participation points in 9 weeks only, which gives him 5-1 = 4 participation marks. But he received good peer ratings for all criteria, and hence get a bonus mark to make it 5/5.
* Chun Ming met the participation points bar in 8 weeks only, giving him 5-2 = 3 marks. He lost 2 more marks because he received very negative ratings for two criteria, giving him 1/5 participation marks.
