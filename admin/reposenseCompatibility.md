We will be using a tool called [RepoSense](https://reposense.org) to make it **easier for you to see (and learn from) code written by others**, and to help us see who wrote which part of the code.

**Viewing the current status of code authorship data:**

* **The report generated by the tool will be made available at [Project Code Dashboard](https://nus-{{ module | lower }}-{{ semester | lower }}.github.io/{{ module | lower }}-dashboard)** at some point in the semester. When it is ready for viewing, you will be notified. The feature that is most relevant to you is the _Code Panel_ (shown on the right side of the screenshot above). It shows the code attributed to a given author. You are welcome to play around with the [other features](https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/blob/release/docs/UserGuide.md#interpreting-the-report) (they are still under development and will not be used for grading this semester).
* Click on your name to load the code attributed to you (based on Git blame/log data) onto the code panel on the right.
* If the code shown roughly matches the code you wrote, all is fine and there is nothing for you to do.

**2. If the code does not match the actual authorship:**

* Here are the possible reasons for the code shown not to match the code you wrote:
  * the git username in some of your commits does not match your GitHub username.
  * the actual authorship does not match the authorship determined by git blame/log e.g., another student touched your code after you wrote it, and Git log attributed the code to that student instead

* In those cases,
  * Install RepoSense (see the [Getting Started](https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/blob/release/docs/UserGuide.md#getting-started) section of the RepoSense User Guide)
  * Use the two methods described in the RepoSense User Guide section [Configuring a Repo to Provide Additional Data to RepoSense](https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/blob/release/docs/UserGuide.md#configuring-a-repo-to-provide-additional-data-to-reposense) to provide additional data to the authorship analysis to make it more accurate.
   * If you add a `config.json` file to your repo (as specified by one of the two methods),
     * **Please use the [template json file given in the module website](https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s1.github.io/cs2103-website/admin/reposenseConfigTemplates.html)** so that your display name matches the name we expect it to be.
     * If your commits have multiple author names, specify all of them e.g., `"authorNames": ["theMyth", "theLegend", "theGary"]`
     * Update the line `config.json` in the `.gitignore` file of your repo as `/config.json` so that it ignores the `config.json` produced by the app but not the `_reposense/config.json`.
   * If you add `@@author` annotations, please follow the guidelines below:

<div class="indented-level3">
<panel header="Adding `@@author` tags to indicate authorship">
  <include src="reposenseAuthorAnnotation.md" />
</panel>
</div>

  * After you are satisfied with the new results (i.e., results produced by running RepoSense locally), push the `config.json` file you added and/or the annotated code to your repo. We'll use that information the next time we run RepoSense (we run it at least once a week).
  * If you choose to annotate code, minimize annotating code chunks smaller than a method. We do not grade code snippets too small to be read meaningfully.
  * If you encounter any problem when doing the above or if you have questions, please post in the [forum]({{ forum_link }}).

==**We recommend you ensure your code is RepoSense-compatible by v1.3**==
