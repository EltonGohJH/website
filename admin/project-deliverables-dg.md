* The Developer Guide (DG) of the product should match the proposed v2.0 of the product and should be in sync with the current version of the product.
* {{ icon_important_big_red }} **The appendix named _Instructions for Manual Testing_** of the Developer Guide should include testing instructions to **cover the features of each team member**. There is no need to add testing instructions for existing AB3 features if you did not touch them.<br>
{{ icon_tip }} What to include in the appendix _Instructions for Manual Testing_? This appendix is meant to give some guidance to the tester to chart a path through the features, and provide some important test inputs the tester can copy-paste into the app. There is no need to give a long list of test cases including all possible variations. It is upto the tester to come up with those variations. However, if the instructions are inaccurate or deliberately misses/mis-states information to make testing harder %%i.e. annoys the tester%%, the tester can report it as a bug %%(because flaws in developer docs are considered as bugs)%% or give a lower rating for the _testability_ of your product.
* Ensure the DG parts included in PPPs match the product precisely, as PPPs will be used by peer evaluators (and ==any inaccuracy in the content will be considered bugs==).
