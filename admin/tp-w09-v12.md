#### {{ icon_individual }} Deliver an intermediate version of the new features

* The feature should be merged and user visible, although simpler than the version you intend to deliver at v1.4.

#### {{ icon_team }} Wrap up milestone

* {{ icon_team }} **Manage the milestone** v1.2 as explained in <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:v12-projectTracking">[Admin {{ icon_embedding }} Appendix E: GitHub: Project Schedule Tracking]</trigger>.
* **Wrap up the milestone** using a git tag `v1.2`. When the milestone deadline is near (e.g., 0.5 days before the deadline), if you think some of the ongoing work intended for the current milestone may not finish in time, reassign them to a future milestone.

<div id="demo">

#### {{ icon_individual }} Demo new features

* **Do an informal demo** of the new features during the tutorial. ==To save time, we recommend that one member demos all new features, using the commit tagged as `v1.2` in the `master` branch== %%i.e. only features included in the current release should be demoed%%.
