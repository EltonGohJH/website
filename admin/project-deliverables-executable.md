* The product should be delivered as an executable jar file.
* Ideally, the product delivered at v1.4 should be a <tooltip content=" i.e., it can be used by end-users">_releasable_</tooltip> product. However, in the interest of lowering your workload, we do not penalize if the product is <tooltip content="i.e., the product is not usable by end-users because some essential features are missing">not releasable</tooltip>, ==as long as the product is <tooltip content="i.e., the features it has can be tested from an end-user perspective">_acceptance testable_</tooltip>==.
