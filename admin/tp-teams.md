#### When to form teams

{% set session = "lecture" if module == "TIC4001" else "tutorial" %}
{% if module != "TIC4001" %}* {{ module }}T: Your team will be formed by the CS2101 side.{% endif %}
* {{ (module + ":") if module != "TIC4001" else "" }} Team forming will be done at the _start_ of the week 3 {{ session }}. If you are not there at the team forming time and others in the class are unaware which team you wanted to be in, we'll have to put you into a team randomly.

#### Team size

* The default ==team size is {{ "four" if module == "TIC4001" else "five"}}==.

#### Team composition

{% if module == "TIC4001" %}
* **You can either form teams yourselves or let us put you in teams.**
{% else %}
* We allow some freedom in choosing team members, subject to these constraints:
  * **All team members should be in the same tutorial.** ==Delay forming teams until your place in a tutorial is confirmed.== We do not allow changing tutorials to team up with your preferred team mates.
  * **Teams of single nationality are not allowed**  unless the only language common among all team members is English. e.g. an all-Singaporean team that include both Chinese and Malay students. %%Rationale: to train you to work in multicultural teams, to ensure that English is used for all project communication%%
  * **No more than one exchange students per team** %%Rationale: to increase interaction between exchange students and NUS students.%%
  * **Same gender teams are discouraged but allowed.** %%Rationale: to train you for mixed-gender work environments.%%
{% endif %}
* **We may modify teams** when circumstances call for it. There is no avenue for you to object. Staying with your preferred team is not guaranteed.

<div id="teamIdFormat">

#### Team ID

* **To be given to you after forming teams.**

{% if module != "TIC4001" %}
* **Has the form `TUTORIAL_ID-TEAM_NUMBER`** e.g, `{{ module }}-W14-2` means you are in tutorial `{{ module }}-W14` (i.e., in module `{{ module }}`, on `Wednesday`, at `1400-1500`), team `2`.

<div class="indented-level2">

{{ embed_topic("tutorials.md#tutorialTimetable", "Admin " + icon_embedding + " Tutorials â†’ Tutorial IDs", "3") }}
</div>
{% else %}
* **Has the form `TUTORIAL_ID-TEAM_NUMBER`** e.g, `{{ module }}-F18-2` which means you are in module `{{ module }}` session `Friday` at `1800`, team `2`.
{% endif %}

<div id="teamCommunication">

#### Team Communications

* **Use English** for all team communications, both spoken and written.
* **We recommend at least one 1-2 hour ==synchronous online== project meeting per week**, in addition to any asynchronous communicating. %%Reason: Having all members available at the same time will facilitate easier collaboration and more peer-learning%%.
  <!--* **We recommend at least one 1-2 hour ==face-to-face== project meeting per week**, in addition to any online meetings. %%Reason: you need to know how to run both types of project meetings%%. The project meeting time can be used to discuss project related things, but also, can be used as a time for team members to work on the project tasks individually (having all members in the same place will facilitate easier collaboration and more peer-learning).-->

  * **Fix a weekly 1-2 hour time slot ~~and a venue~~ for project meetings** after the team has been finalized (latest by the end of week 3 {{ session }}). ==All members are expected to attend weekly project meetings== (not doing so could lower the peer evaluation ratings you receive, which in turn will be factored into your grade).
  * {{ icon_tip }} **The best time for the weekly project meeting** is, soon after the lecture but before the deadline for weekly tasks, closer to the lecture than the deadline. %%Reason: _After_ the lecture means you'll have the knowledge required for upcoming project tasks and _before_ the deadline means you can use the meeting to help weekly project tasks.%%
