**:fas-comment: My comments:**


Understandably, some of you prefer live lectures (F2F or online) -- one advantage of those modes is that
 you can ask questions immediately if something is unclear.<br>
==On-the-spot Q&A doesn't scale up to very large classes==, unfortunately --
 even if your question is relevant to half the class, it becomes a disruption to
 hundreds of other students, especially so for a module like ours
 in which the students' learning speed can vary a lot.<br>
Hence, our live lectures are online and limited to briefings only, while most content are delivered as text and
 prerecorded lectures which students can consume at their own pace.
 While I can still answer some questions at the end of the lecture, the rest needs to be asynchronous
 e.g., via email or the forum.<br>
 On the positive side,
 we follow multiple topic threads every week, which means you can continue learning other topic
 threads while waiting for an answer. Also, the topics are not that deep/complex
 -- the chance of getting stuck is lower.<br>
 So, I hope you guys are able to manage even if I don't do live lectures covering all content.<br>
 As for F2F lectures, it is out of the question right now due to COVID rules, and might not be possible
 even after, due to the lack of venues that can support such a big class size :-(

==Unlike most modules that use lectures as the 'first step' to learning the module content, our lecture briefings
 serve as a complementary 'top up'==, covering additional examples, motivations behind the topics, commentary on
 how to shape your attitudes related to the subject, anecdotes, etc.
Hence, you can skip lecture briefings (or simply speed-watch the recording later) if you
 are short of time or if you think they are not useful to you.
 Even the in-lecture quiz questions are 'optional' in the sense they are unlikely to make a
 difference in your final participation marks.<br>
 :fas-exclamation: Note: Totally ignoring the lecture briefings will exclude you from future CS2103/T tutor positions
 though, as I do not want to employ as a tutor someone who hasn't received the _full view_ of the module
 (I often talk about the goals/rationales of the module during lecture briefings
 -- not examinable but important nevertheless, especially for a future tutor).

**:fas-comment: My comments:**


Admittedly, our tutorials can feel slow, less efficient, or less active. If you are the type of student
  that prepare well for the tutorials and actively take part in tutorial discussions, this is indeed the case.
  I hope you still bear with us because ==the tutorial structure (like many other things in this module)
  is intended to _raise the lower bar of the whole class_, which is important when there is a major team project
  (to reduce the skill gap between team members)==.
  * **We start with a 10-minute warm up** to give everyone at least a chance to familiarize with the tutorial tasks
    even if they haven't had time to look at them earlier (we don't want them to be left out totally).
  * **By requiring _everyone_ to respond via private messages**, we aim to get everyone to _think_ about the topic
    at hand and attempt to answer without being biased by others’ answers.
    As I mentioned in a previous lecture, pedagogy research has shown that this act of thinking/attempting
    before receiving the correct answer increases the effectiveness of learning,
    even if you get the answer wrong at first.<br>
    That said, we do want to have some verbal discussions to happen too. That's why we ask you to do the follow up
    discussions verbally.
  * **We monitor tutorial participation** because tutorials are used for ensuring that you all have achieved the desired
    learning targets for the week. If not, slower students tend to neglect the theory part
    (in a misguided attempt to save time) and try to brute-force the project work, which wastes even more time,
    and also exacerbates the skill-gap problems in their teams.
  * So, while the number of questions we go through in each tutorial is fewer and the questions are simpler,
    _getting everyone to answer almost every question on the spot_ (this is different from answering a quiz _at your own
    convenience_, which we already do anyway) has ==a higher total learning gain for the entire class==.<br>
    So, if you are one of the
    stronger students getting less out of our tutorials than you are used to get from other modules, I hope
    you'll be generous and take a 'hit' here to allow your classmates to level up. You might even benefit yourself
    from their levelled-up contributions when you work with them in the team project.

The feedback for the module website is generally positive but some areas to improve have been mentioned.
  Thanks for bringing those up. I will continue to try and improve the website whenever I can.<br>
  In the meantime, I thank you for your patience with the website -- it's not easy to disseminate that much
  of information in a way that fits everyone's expectations %%(e.g., some prefer more content to be more 'visual'
  while others prefer minimalistic presentation)%%,
  and I realize that ==it is not easy for you to consume that much of information== either.

**:fas-comment: My comments:**


The most common concern about this module is the workload.
  I’m afraid it is not going to get any lower in the second half :-(.
  Some suggestions:
  * If you are already struggling with the iP workload, don’t be too ambitious with the tP.
    In particular, choose the ‘evolve’ option rather than ‘morph’ option (it’s still not too late to change).
    If you choose the ‘morph’ option, don’t plan to morph it too far away from AB3.<br>
    Reminder: there are no marks allocated for marking the product interesting, unique, cool, etc.<br>
    Also, keep in mind that it is the quality that will count more than the quantity.
    In most cases the quantity is graded on an S/U basis (refer to the Week 6 tP briefing for more info).
    Aim to do less but do it really well.
  * If you don't have time to study all topics, use the
    [star ratings system](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s2.github.io/website/admin/moduleExpectations.html#star-rating-system)
    to figure out which topics are higher priority.
  * That said, I know the workload concern is real, and I firmly believe that no module should take more than
    its fair share of students' time. On the other hand, this module aims to teach you SE skills that take a lot
    of practice (hence the high workload).<br>
    We've managed to reduce the workload of this module quite bit over the past semesters, and we'll continue to
    do so when we find ways to do that without compromising our learning outcomes.

The pace itself seems to be less of a problem compared to the workload.<br>
Don't worry if you feel like the module is moving too fast; thanks to the iterative approach we use for covering topics,
 you'll get multiple chances to solidify your familiarity of a topic/tool.

<markdown>The module that I enjoyed the most in my two year in CS. Very well paced. One minor problem that I found is the GUI week.

<markdown>I feel that the 2103 portion of the module is good. However, I really detest that I have to take 2101 with it. Or even take 2101 at all. No offence to the tutor as she has put in alot of effort, but 2x2hour lessons a week on how to present/how to have good team meetings seems kind of excessive workload. If I really have to spend 4 hours a week learning how to communicate with others than honestly I've probably just been a recluse for the last decade of my life. I dont think taking 2101 is going to encourage those who don't intend to participate actively in discussions in the first place, participate actively in any other group discussions for the rest of their time in NUS. And if so, with their lack of practice, I doubt there will be improvements in their communication skills when they enter the workplace. To be fair, the second portion of 2101 on writing User Guides is useful. But I really dont understand the obsession with spending so much time taking lessons on communication. In all honesty I don't see anything wrong with taking it, but the workload spent on it is too high.</markdown>

<box type="info" icon=":fas-comment:" light><span class="text-info"><markdown>I wont comment on this as it's a different module. But given that you don't see yourself getting a lot of practice outside of the module, perhaps it is a good thing that you get to 'overdo' it in the module?

<markdown>The current pace of the module is a bit quick and the workload is higher than average, but not unmanageable. However, this is probably because I have participated in a software engineering internship before and have picked up related skills (such as maven which is functions similarly to gradle). I think the skills taught are very essential and will be of much use to any student who wishes to work in a computing related field.

The current balance between lectures, pre-recorded videos and textbook is ideal, as it allows students to learn in the way that most suits them, all in all so far a great module that gives students flexibility in learning content. It is evident that the teaching team is passionate about teaching the subject and employ suitable pedagogical methods to ensure that students have an enjoyable learning experience.</markdown>

<markdown>For the team project, it is hard to think of meaningful applications of AB3 (as you can see from the PRs, many groups are targeting university students). I couldn't even come up with an app that appeals to me.</markdown>

<box type="info" icon=":fas-comment:" light><span class="text-info"><markdown>It is good if you can think of a suitable application, but OK if you can't. It is also OK to focus on a narrow and contrived target user too. E.g., someone who is trying to learn a new language and looking for a way to store new words/phrases she come across.</markdown>

<markdown>I think especially the weeks that introduce Gradle and JavaFX, the topics that we had to cover on top of learning those 2 non-trivial tools felt a bit too overwhelming. Specifically with JavaFX, its my first time working with a GUI of some kind and the "tutorial" in the project tab did not really help much in terms of getting to know the features of JavaFX or how to work with it. I get that a level of proactive learning is expected of us but if the GUI component of our tP is going to be put under great scrutiny when grading, I hope there will be a place for us to get some advanced tips or lessons to use the more relevant JavaFX features.</markdown>

<box type="info" icon=":fas-comment:" light><span class="text-info"><markdown>Indeed, that week of the iP is especially hard. As someone else suggested above, we'll get students to learn the JavaFX a bit earlier next time.

But note that the tP GUI is not specifically graded for anything unless you choose to focus on the GUI yourself. It's perfectly fine to not change the tP GUI at all and just improve the other things e.g., make the commands better or add more commands</markdown>

<box type="info" icon=":fas-comment:" light><span class="text-info"><markdown>Yes, having to cover multiple topics in the same week can be jarring.

<markdown>The workload is too heavy. 50+ online quiz questions and hundreds of lines of code per week makes me extremely tired. I need to spend 4 to 5 hours reading the online note and completing the quiz and another one to two days writing the IP. The project meeting takes another 2 hours per week. While the zoom lecture almost teaches nothing at all. The amount of workload is heavier than the sum of my other 3 core modules.
I would like to suggest reducing the number of quiz questions and cancelling the zoom lecture. And if possible, please provide us with a break.</markdown>

<box type="info" icon=":fas-comment:" light><span class="text-info"><markdown>Indeed, the workload is the biggest complaint. Do take advantage of the flexibility we have provided to reduce the worklaod. For example, the lecture is optional. You can skip it if it pushing you beyond the time you can allocate to this module.

<markdown>I think the module giving allowances in deadline of completing iP weekly tasks has been very reassuring and reduces stress, as I can focus on learning rather than rushing to finish tasks.</markdown>

<box type="info" icon=":fas-comment:" light><span class="text-info"><markdown>Glad to hear that :-) No need to stress too much about deadlines -- they are mostly there for you to see if you are keep pace or falling behind.

But do plan to make the tP final submissoin deadline as that one is strict :-p</markdown>

<box type="info" icon=":fas-comment:" light><span class="text-info"><markdown>Yes, this might happen in rare cases although we have put in extra work to ensure the sequencing is correct.

Also note that the recommended order is to learn the weekly topics _before_ doing weekly project tasks. For the week 4, the weekly topics include some code quality topics, and the PR review was specifically limited to the code qaulity topics covered in that week only.</markdown>

<markdown>Had some troubles following the simple git tutorial on the module website. Had to look up for a lot other information to learn git. I also felt that the workload in week 3 was heavier than other weeks so far. Maybe could balance it out a bit. Overall the workload is manageable after 3 weeks to get used to it.</markdown>

<box type="info" icon=":fas-comment:" light><span class="text-info"><markdown>Glad to hear you've got used to it now. Yes, it can be a bit 'too much' in the first few weeks. Also, it would help if you raise an issue in the forum if you encounted a gap in the tutorials/materials provided -- that can help us fix it immediately, or in the next round. If it turns out you missed something yourself, someone will be able to point it to you quickly, and you could save a lot of time that you would spend looking for materials elsewhere.</markdown>

<box type="info" header="++My general responses for points raised multiple times++"
 icon=":fas-comment:" icon-size="2x" light >

Given below are some general responses to points you guys (and past students) raised multiple times:


* **Why not start tP earlier?**: This too relates to the skill-gap problem mentioned above. We need time to raise
  the lower bar of the skills in the class so that the skill gap between team members can be smaller.<br>
  Even if your team is not affected by the skill gap issue, as mentioned in the most recent lecture,
  the project is simply a sandbox to practice using various tools/techniques -- which means we have to wait till we
  had time to learn those tools/techniques before practicing them in the project. To give an example, you could have
  started the project early and used the code itself to understand the current AB3 design -- but because we waited
  till we learned how to interpret UML diagrams, we now have a chance to practice using UML diagrams to understand
  a new code base.
* **JavaFX** (and the tech stack) While JavaFX is the de-facto UI technology for Java desktop apps,
  the chances of you using it in future is low, given most Java work tend to be back-end/server-side.
  Hence, it's fine if you are not very comfortable with JavaFX -- the tP/iP can be done without an in-depth
  knowledge of it.<br>
  At the same time, it is good to get _some_ exposure to a GUI framework too.
  While JavaFX is not the best GUI framework, it has some similarities with GUI frameworks, and knowing it might help
  you if you had to use one such GUI framework in future.
* **Working on weekends**: I realize that having to work on the weekend is not ideal.
  In our case it feels even worse because our lecture
  is on Friday and the tasks for the next week are released on Friday as a result. In theory, it is possible to
  not work on weekends nevertheless; but in practice, I can't imagine the typical SoC workload can be done
  without working through at least _some_ part of the weekend. It is one of the sacrifices one has to make to be in
  an in-demand field such as CS, especially if you don't have some programming experience already.<br>
  If it makes you feel better, I can't even remember the last time I did not have to work through the weekend :-(
