**:fas-comment: My comments:**


Understandably, a few of you prefer live lectures (F2F or online) -- one advantage of those modes is that
 you can ask questions immediately if something is unclear.<br>
==On-the-spot Q&A doesn't scale up to very large classes==, unfortunately --
 even if your question is relevant to half the class, it becomes a disruption to
 hundreds of other students, especially so for a module like ours
 in which the students' learning speed can vary a lot.
 Besides, no venue available is big enough to accommodate our class size.<br>
Hence, our live lectures are limited to briefings only, while most content are delivered as text and
 pre-recorded lectures which students can consume at their own pace.<br>
 Nevertheless, ==you can attend lectures F2F if you wish==, as we have now moved to hybrid mode lectures,
 although we are unlikely to support mid-lecture interactions due to the reason given above.
 While I can still answer some questions at the end of the lecture, the rest needs to be asynchronous
 e.g., via email or the forum.<br>
 On the positive side, we follow multiple topic threads every week, which means you can continue learning other topic
 threads while waiting for an answer you raised asynchronously. Also, the topics are not that deep/complex
 -- the chance of getting stuck is lower.<br>
 So, I hope you guys are able to manage even if I don't do live lectures covering all content.<br>

**:fas-comment: My comments:**


==Unlike most modules that use lectures as the _primary_ mechanism for delivering module content, our lecture briefings
 serve as a _complementary_ 'top up'==, covering additional examples, motivations behind the topics, commentary on
 how to shape your attitudes related to the subject, anecdotes, etc.
Hence, you can skip lecture briefings (or simply speed-watch the recording later) if you
 are short of time or if you think they are not useful to you.
 Even the in-lecture quiz questions are 'optional' in the sense they are unlikely to make a
 difference in your final participation marks.<br>
 :fas-exclamation: Note: Totally ignoring the lecture briefings will exclude you from future CS2103/T tutor positions
 though, as I do not want to employ as a tutor someone who hasn't received the _full view_ of the module
 (I often talk about the goals/rationales of the module during lecture briefings
 -- not examinable but important nevertheless, especially for a future tutor).

Although the majority is OK with the current mode of tutorials, a notable portion prefers F2F tutorials.
While the hybrid mode seems like a good compromise, it is not that easy to implement due to logistics issues
and lack of enough venues. We will be staying with the current mode for this semester, but will look
for a better alternative in future semesters.

**:fas-comment: My comments:**


Admittedly, our tutorials can feel slow, less efficient, or less active. For students who otherwise
  prepare well for the tutorials and actively take part in tutorial discussions, this is indeed the case.
  I hope you still bear with us because ==the tutorial structure (like many other things in this module)
  is intended to _raise the lower bar of the whole class_, which is important when there is a major team project
  (to reduce the skill gap between team members)==.
  * **We start with a 10-minute warm up** to give everyone at least a chance to familiarize with the tutorial tasks
    even if they haven't had time to look at them earlier (we don't want them to be left out entirely).
  * **By requiring _everyone_ to respond via private messages**, we aim to get everyone to _think_ about the topic
    at hand and attempt to answer without being biased by others’ answers.
    As I mentioned in a previous lecture, pedagogy research has shown that this act of thinking/attempting
    before receiving the correct answer increases the effectiveness of learning,
    even if you get the answer wrong at first.<br>
    That said, we do want to have some verbal discussions to happen too. That's why we ask you to do the follow up
    discussions verbally.
  * **We monitor tutorial participation** because tutorials are used for ensuring that you all have achieved the desired
    learning targets for the week. If not, slower students tend to neglect the theory part
    (in a misguided attempt to save time) and try to brute-force the project work, which wastes even more time,
    and also exacerbates the skill-gap problems in their teams.
  * So, while the number of questions we go through in each tutorial is fewer and the questions are simpler,
    _getting everyone to answer almost every question on the spot_ (this is different from answering a quiz _at your own
    convenience_, which we already do anyway) has ==a higher total learning gain for the entire class==.<br>
    So, if you are one of the
    stronger students getting less out of our tutorials than you are used to get from other modules, I hope
    you'll be generous and take a 'hit' here to allow your classmates to level up. You might even benefit yourself
    from their levelled-up contributions when you work with them in the team project.

The feedback for the module website is generally positive but there are still _some_ areas to improve further.
  Thanks for your feedback on those. I will continue to try and improve the website whenever I can.<br>
  In the meantime, I thank you for your patience with the website -- it's not easy to disseminate that much
  of information in a way that fits everyone's expectations %%(e.g., some prefer more content to be more 'visual'
  while others prefer minimalistic presentation)%%,
  and I realize that ==it is not easy for you to consume that much of information== either.

**:fas-comment: My comments:**


The most common concern about this module is the workload.
  I’m afraid it is not going to get any lower in the second half :-(.
  Some suggestions:
  * If you are already struggling with the iP workload, don’t be too ambitious with the tP.
    In particular, choose the ‘evolve’ option rather than ‘morph’ option (it’s still not too late to change).
    If you choose the ‘morph’ option, don’t plan to morph it too far away from AB3.<br>
    Reminder: there are no marks allocated for marking the product interesting, unique, cool, etc.<br>
    Also, keep in mind that it is the quality that will count more than the quantity.
    In most cases the quantity is graded on an S/U basis (refer to the Week 6 tP briefing for more info).
    Aim to do less but do it really well.
  * If you don't have time to study all topics, use the
    [topic levels](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s1.github.io/website/admin/moduleExpectations.html#topic-levels)
    to figure out which topics are higher priority.
  * That said, I know the workload concern is real, and I firmly believe that no module should take more than
    its fair share of students' time. On the other hand, this module aims to teach you SE skills that take a lot
    of practice (hence the high workload).<br>
    We've managed to reduce the workload of this module quite bit over the past semesters, and we'll continue to
    do so when we find ways to do that without compromising our learning outcomes.

The pace itself seems to be less of a problem compared to the workload.<br>
Don't worry if you feel like the module is moving too fast; thanks to the iterative approach we use for covering topics,
 you'll get multiple chances to solidify your familiarity of a topic/tool.

<markdown>While I can understand the rationale behind the tutors not providing technical help or administrative help (I would not want to do it either if I were a TA), I'm not too sure what their purpose is in this module. Are they there to only assist when we have questions relating to the theoretical material?

I hope that as we proceed into tP we will at least have an indication of whether our project is sufficiently complex (or some other form of basic guidance without the need to delve too deep into the code specifics). Will the TA be able to help if we are unsure if a certain piece of code in the tP conflicts with a SWE principle mentioned in the textbook?</markdown>

<box type="info" icon=":fas-comment:" light><span class="text-info"><markdown>1. Yup, tutors have a limited role in this module, which is primarily to deliver the tutorial. They will also watch out for their teams making any major mistakes in the project (i.e., as a sanity check and a safety net).

2. I understand your worry about "are we doing enough in the project?" The tP briefing that I did in week 7 lecture includes how to answer this question yourselves. Also keep in mind that the quantity of work is less important than quality. The quantity ceases to affect your marks as long as you pass the bar on effort expectations.

3. For the question "Does this code conflicts with SWE principles?" it's best to raise such questions in the forum so that I can address them in a way not unfair to other teams (because the answe to that question is a project decision that you will be graded on later). </markdown>

Yes, when considered in isolation and when compared to other modules, this is a fair statement. But note that given the content is already provided in other modes (i.e., textbook and pre-recorded videos), going through them again in the lecture can also be considered a 'waste'. That's why the lectures contain complementary content, albeit not as useful as the primary content given in the textbook and the pre-recorded videos.</markdown>

However, for the videos in the website, it sometimes get quite difficult to understand what is being spoken when played at higher speeds. Perhaps a subtitle option would be nice?

Also regarding workload there might be abit much for some weeks. This issue could be solved if this mod was a 6mc mod though :D

For videos, auto-captioning is unlikely to give good results either. You may have to watch such videos at lower speeds, for the time being. Will try to enunciate better the next time I record those vidoes.

Unfortunately, increasing the MC of a core module is not that easy, as this is taken by students doing CS minors. But yes, it is something I have been lobbying for, for a while now. </markdown>

<markdown>I'm starting to fall behind on iP as workload from my other CS modules are increasing. As I'm used to setting aside long hours to work on iP, it has become challenging for me to do so and I feel very disapointed in myself because I do want to deliver a good iP product that I can be proud of, but I just can't balance the time spent on this and other modules.</markdown>

<box type="info" icon=":fas-comment:" light><span class="text-info"><markdown>Sorry to hear that. As you can see above (see [my comment on 'The workload'](#Q8)), there are quite a few others struggling with the workload (i.e., you are not alone). The tP briefing I did last week also touches on managing the tP workload. The short answer is, control the worload by doing less when requirements are open-ended (e.g., tP features).</markdown>

<markdown>Post-lecture quizzes are too long. Cap them at 20 questions max.

Too many weekly tasks to do. Having to do iP, tP, admin matters, quizzes, in addition to learning the week's content is too much weekly work for a 4MC module.

Lectures don't add much value to the module by giving a brief overview of the week's content. The textbook materials on the course website are well written and comprehensive and do not need to be supplemented by lectures. Hence, lectures should be dropped altogether to give students more time to do the weekly tasks.</markdown>

<box type="info" icon=":fas-comment:" light><span class="text-info"><markdown>Yup, the workoad is an issue for quite a number of students (see [my comment on 'The workload'](#Q8)).

I will see if there are redundant questions that I can trim, when I migrate the quizzes to Canvas next semester.

Um, you can skip lectures if you don't have time for it or if they don't add value to you.</markdown>

<markdown>Main issue is probably workload, figuring how much to exchange each unit of time with each improvement of code (code quality in particular) since code can really keep improving. Since iP seems to be on a somewhat flexible schedule, I've been spreading out the work a bit, though I'll have some catching-up to do. Team is pretty fine though might still need to recognize synergies between us, who works well together and how to work well together.</markdown>

<markdown>I still find the workload of this module a lot higher than other modules I'm taking. As a result, most of my week is spent on this mod rather than others as this is the only way I can manage so that my work doesn't pile up.

<box type="info" icon=":fas-comment:" light><span class="text-info"><markdown>It's true that the workload is heavier in this module. If you managed to cope so far, I expect you can do so for the remainder as well.

<markdown>Sometimes I get really overwhelmed with the workload as you need to do increments of the iP and tP each week. Currently I am still managing well, but I am afraid I might fall behind in the subsequent weeks. </markdown>
