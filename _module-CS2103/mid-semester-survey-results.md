**:fas-comment: My comments:**


Understandably, a few of you prefer live lectures (F2F or online) -- one advantage of those modes is that
 you can ask questions immediately if something is unclear.<br>
==On-the-spot Q&A doesn't scale up to very large classes==, unfortunately --
 even if your question is relevant to half the class, it becomes a disruption to
 hundreds of other students, especially so for a module like ours
 in which the students' learning speed can vary a lot.
 Besides, no venue available is big enough to accommodate our class size.<br>
Hence, our live lectures are limited to briefings only, while most content are delivered as text and
 pre-recorded lectures which students can consume at their own pace.<br>
 Nevertheless, ==you can attend lectures F2F if you wish==, as we have now moved to hybrid mode lectures, 
 although we are unlikely to support mid-lecture interactions due to the reason given above.
 While I can still answer some questions at the end of the lecture, the rest needs to be asynchronous
 e.g., via email or the forum.<br>
 On the positive side, we follow multiple topic threads every week, which means you can continue learning other topic
 threads while waiting for an answer you raised asynchronously. Also, the topics are not that deep/complex
 -- the chance of getting stuck is lower.<br>
 So, I hope you guys are able to manage even if I don't do live lectures covering all content.<br>

==Unlike most modules that use lectures as the _primary_ mechanism for delivering module content, our lecture briefings
 serve as a _complementary_ 'top up'==, covering additional examples, motivations behind the topics, commentary on
 how to shape your attitudes related to the subject, anecdotes, etc.
Hence, you can skip lecture briefings (or simply speed-watch the recording later) if you 
 are short of time or if you think they are not useful to you.
 Even the in-lecture quiz questions are 'optional' in the sense they are unlikely to make a
 difference in your final participation marks.<br>
 :fas-exclamation: Note: Totally ignoring the lecture briefings will exclude you from future CS2103/T tutor positions
 though, as I do not want to employ as a tutor someone who hasn't received the _full view_ of the module
 (I often talk about the goals/rationales of the module during lecture briefings
 -- not examinable but important nevertheless, especially for a future tutor).

Although the majority is OK with the current mode of tutorials, a notable portion prefers F2F tutorials.
While the hybrid mode seems like a good compromise, it is not that easy to implement due to logistics issues
and lack of enough venues. We will be staying with the current mode for this semester, but will look
for a better alternative in future semesters.

**:fas-comment: My comments:**


Admittedly, our tutorials can feel slow, less efficient, or less active. For students who otherwise
  prepare well for the tutorials and actively take part in tutorial discussions, this is indeed the case.
  I hope you still bear with us because ==the tutorial structure (like many other things in this module)
  is intended to _raise the lower bar of the whole class_, which is important when there is a major team project
  (to reduce the skill gap between team members)==. 
  * **We start with a 10-minute warm up** to give everyone at least a chance to familiarize with the tutorial tasks
    even if they haven't had time to look at them earlier (we don't want them to be left out entirely).
  * **By requiring _everyone_ to respond via private messages**, we aim to get everyone to _think_ about the topic
    at hand and attempt to answer without being biased by others’ answers.
    As I mentioned in a previous lecture, pedagogy research has shown that this act of thinking/attempting
    before receiving the correct answer increases the effectiveness of learning,
    even if you get the answer wrong at first.<br>
    That said, we do want to have some verbal discussions to happen too. That's why we ask you to do the follow up
    discussions verbally.
  * **We monitor tutorial participation** because tutorials are used for ensuring that you all have achieved the desired
    learning targets for the week. If not, slower students tend to neglect the theory part 
    (in a misguided attempt to save time) and try to brute-force the project work, which wastes even more time,
    and also exacerbates the skill-gap problems in their teams.
  * So, while the number of questions we go through in each tutorial is fewer and the questions are simpler,
    _getting everyone to answer almost every question on the spot_ (this is different from answering a quiz _at your own
    convenience_, which we already do anyway) has ==a higher total learning gain for the entire class==.<br>
    So, if you are one of the
    stronger students getting less out of our tutorials than you are used to get from other modules, I hope
    you'll be generous and take a 'hit' here to allow your classmates to level up. You might even benefit yourself
    from their levelled-up contributions when you work with them in the team project.

The feedback for the module website is generally positive but there are still _some_ areas to improve further.
  Thanks for your feedback on those. I will continue to try and improve the website whenever I can.<br>
  In the meantime, I thank you for your patience with the website -- it's not easy to disseminate that much
  of information in a way that fits everyone's expectations %%(e.g., some prefer more content to be more 'visual'
  while others prefer minimalistic presentation)%%,
  and I realize that ==it is not easy for you to consume that much of information== either.

**:fas-comment: My comments:**


The most common concern about this module is the workload.
  I’m afraid it is not going to get any lower in the second half :-(.
  Some suggestions:
  * If you are already struggling with the iP workload, don’t be too ambitious with the tP.
    In particular, choose the ‘evolve’ option rather than ‘morph’ option (it’s still not too late to change).
    If you choose the ‘morph’ option, don’t plan to morph it too far away from AB3.<br>
    Reminder: there are no marks allocated for marking the product interesting, unique, cool, etc.<br>
    Also, keep in mind that it is the quality that will count more than the quantity. 
    In most cases the quantity is graded on an S/U basis (refer to the Week 6 tP briefing for more info).
    Aim to do less but do it really well.
  * If you don't have time to study all topics, use the 
    [topic levels system](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s2.github.io/website/admin/moduleExpectations.html#topic-levels)
    to figure out which topics are higher priority.
  * That said, I know the workload concern is real, and I firmly believe that no module should take more than
    its fair share of students' time. On the other hand, this module aims to teach you SE skills that take a lot
    of practice (hence the high workload).<br>
    We've managed to reduce the workload of this module quite bit over the past semesters, and we'll continue to
    do so when we find ways to do that without compromising our learning outcomes.

The pace itself seems to be less of a problem compared to the workload.<br>
Don't worry if you feel like the module is moving too fast; thanks to the iterative approach we use for covering topics,
 you'll get multiple chances to solidify your familiarity of a topic/tool.

<markdown>Whilst I understand that it is an attempt to simulate how a project would progress in the industry, I feel that it would be better to first have the students to do clean code and explain how the code would develop. I feel that I spend too much time on refactoring or redoing my code just to fit the new requirements, or not being able to find a spot to place the new requirements that are not optional. 

I am grateful however, that this module is a little more flexible (i.e. week 5 can still be working on week 3 items), since CS2109's first few weeks is very code intensive, I found it very difficult to balance between refactoring and redoing code, and answering CS2109 problem sets. 

I am not very sure what is the point of the physical lecture right now, but perhaps it is because I came from a polytechnic background, and I know roughly what to expect from the industry and working with people. </markdown>

However, I would like to suggest less "nesting" for the website. It is not uncommon to have to open drop-down menus 3-4 levels deep. It quickly becomes confusing which layer I am currently on. While I appreciate the effort, it may counter-intuitively make the website harder to comprehend.

<markdown>* I don't like the module website, it's hard for a student to keep track of which are the parts that the student has already done reading, I don't like to navigate here and there. (I would rather have a pdf version of it so that students can annotate and take note on them)

* I hate watching pre-recorded lecture, then suddenly I have to context switch to reading, then context switch to watching, and repeat. As you may have already known, switching between reading and watching videos modes are "expensive" for human (just like context switch in operating systems)

* The project task can cause serious workload cascading. If one didn't manage to follow the requirement for a particular week, he/she may be very difficult to follow the subsequent week's deliverables as they are built upon previous week's result. So, I suggest instead of making the deadline weekly, we make them biweekly.</markdown>

<markdown>I really enjoy the course and what it teaches, I just feel that it is very overwhelming at times. It'll be great if some weeks are just there to let us catch up/add additional features if we're free and interested to do so. I think that if I could afford to put more time into the module and feel constant stress, it'll be a lot more enjoyable. Currently, having to redo code in an iterative sense is giving a lot of anxiety because there seems to be so many other things to wrap my mind around and keep track of. I just think that if this module was given more MCs, or was given more time (2 semesters) it'll be a very wonderful learning experience.</markdown>

But the forums mostly addresses the problems I faced so far so overall I would say the support system is pretty okay for me!</markdown>

<markdown>I am enjoying this module a lot. Regarding the workload, I find that the pacing is done well - much of the work is in the first 2 weeks, while other modules don't have that much assignments yet. After week 3 - 4, increments to our codebase slows down slows down significantly as our other modules have more submissions due. I think it is quite fair and I have enjoyed working on my IP so far. 

I appreciate the effort taken to constantly update us through the course website and dashboards, personalised emails and other channels of our progress in the module. I find it is very encouraging to receive such constant feedback about what is done well or could be done better.</markdown>

<markdown>I do not think the module website is optimized for phone viewing. Contents are usually cut off when viewed on my phone. Also, for videos with quiz attached on phone browser (safari), after completing the quiz, when the continue button is clicked to close the quiz page and back to the video, the quiz tab reopens again (have to find some creative way to close it instead of the continue button if not it is an endless cycle of closing and reopening).

Other than that, I appreciate that the profs are working towards bettering the welfare of the students. They are also passionate in what they do and teach, it is obviously manifested in the lectures, website, etc. Good job! I am enjoying this module a lot because of it.</markdown>

<markdown>I think it would be more manageable if the theory covered every week is less heavy. There is a lot to read on the website. Also, the quiz on Canvas covers questions that aren't covered during lecture and on the website, and the internet does not give a definite answer to those questions. Would be better if the questions are covered in class or the website itself.

But I think the module is great and the classes are well executed, thank you!</markdown>

<markdown>I am really enjoying the module so far. I am seeing tangible results from my work in terms of having a functional product and having developed important skills such as version control. I am also very appreciative of the detailed one-to-one feedback that was provided by Prof Damith regarding our pre-module survey. I like the way that this module is carried out as personally, I prefer learning at my own pace.</markdown>

<box type="info" header="++My general responses for points raised multiple times++"
 icon=":fas-comment:" icon-size="2x" light >

Given below are some general responses to points you guys (and past students) raised multiple times:


* **Why not start tP earlier?**: This too relates to the skill-gap problem mentioned above. We need time to raise
  the lower bar of the skills in the class so that the skill gap between team members can be smaller.<br>
  Even if your team is not affected by the skill gap issue, as mentioned in the most recent lecture,
  the project is simply a sandbox to practice using various tools/techniques -- which means we have to wait till we
  had time to learn those tools/techniques before practicing them in the project. To give an example, you could have
  started the project early and used the code itself to understand the current AB3 design -- but because we waited
  till we learned how to interpret UML diagrams, we now have a chance to practice using UML diagrams to understand 
  a new code base.
* **JavaFX** (and the tech stack) While JavaFX is the de-facto UI technology for Java desktop apps,
  the chances of you using it in future is low, given most Java work tend to be back-end/server-side.
  Hence, it's fine if you are not very comfortable with JavaFX -- the tP/iP can be done without an in-depth
  knowledge of it.<br>
  At the same time, it is good to get _some_ exposure to a GUI framework too.
  While JavaFX is not the best GUI framework, it has some similarities with GUI frameworks, and knowing it might help
  you if you had to use one such GUI framework in future. 
* **Working on weekends**: I realize that having to work on the weekend is not ideal.
  In our case it feels even worse because our lecture 
  is on Friday and the tasks for the next week are released on Friday as a result. In theory, it is possible to
  not work on weekends nevertheless; but in practice, I can't imagine the typical SoC workload can be done
  without working through at least _some_ part of the weekend. It is one of the sacrifices one has to make to be in
  an in-demand field such as CS, especially if you don't have some programming experience already.<br>
  If it makes you feel better, I can't even remember the last time I did not have to work through the weekend :-(
