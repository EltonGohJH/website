**:fas-comment: My comments:**


Understandably, some of you prefer live lectures (F2F or online) -- one advantage of those modes is that
 you can ask questions immediately if something is unclear.
 Another prof of F2F is the ease of receiving hands-on help for programming-related problems
 (although this doesn't apply when safe-distancing is in effect).
 Some drawbacks are higher risk of catching COVID, the time spent on travel etc.<br>
Recorded lectures have the advantage of higher-speed viewing, immediate rewind-replay,
 fewer mistakes, view at any time etc. although not being able to see the presenter's body language could
 be a drawback.<br>
So, it's hard to pick a winner among these options. Hopefully, our current mix of modes is good enough to
 keep everyone reasonably happy :-)

The feedback for the module website is generally positive but some areas to improve have been mentioned.
  Thanks for bringing those up. I will continue to try and improve the website whenever I can.<br>
  In the meantime, I thank you for your patience with the website -- it's not easy to disseminate that much
  of information in a way that fits everyone's expectations %%(e.g., some prefer more content to be more 'visual'
  while others prefer minimalistic presentation)%%,
  and I realize that ==it is not easy for you to consume that much of information== either.

**:fas-comment: My comments:**


* **If the workload is too high:** I realize this module can feel heavy, especially if you don't have prior programming
  experience, and also if you have a day job too.<br>
  That said, SE modules are usually heavy because learning SE skills needs a lot of practice.<br>
  I try to alleviate the workload problem by keeping deadlines fairly flexible and maintaining a low bar for
  the minimum you need to do to get a decent grade.
* **If you have room for more work:**
  * Try to do more in the project: The project is open ended are you are encouraged to do as much as you want.
    You can refer to [Duke full description](https://nus-tic2002-2022.github.io/website/se-book-adapted/projectDuke/index.html) to find
    more things you can do with it.
  * Learn the optional topics: I have added a lot more optional topics to the second half of the semester.
    This means there is more to learn every week, if you have the capacity to do so.

**:fas-comment: My comments:**


* **If the pace is too fast for you:** Not to worry; thanks to the iterative approach we use for covering topics,
  you'll get multiple chances to solidify your familiarity of a topic/tool. Do what you can every week and
  ==try not to fall too far behind== though.
* **If the pace is too slow for you:** I have add more optional topics to the second half of the semester,
  and made all pre-recorded videos for future lectures available (previously, videos were available upto only
  two weeks into the future). This means you should be able to move faster through the weeks if you wish.

<markdown>Module website takes awhile to get used to - but eventually I was able to understand the format and it was immensely helpful in my understanding.

Pace of lecture is okay, though I do feel the weekly exercises are a little too easy to test my understanding. A more challenging exercise, given 2-3 weeks to complete, would be more beneficial for me.</markdown>

<markdown>I like this approach for this module because it focuses a lot on self-driven learning and seeking help when stuck, rather than the traditional approach of being forced to sit down for hours of lectures after lectures. This is more practical approach for working students who are usually very tired after a day's work.
Also, the teaching team is highly responsive and proactively keeps track of our progress to help us.</markdown>

<markdown>There are a couple of things that we need to do every week. I like to break them down into -
1. studying the lecture topics to answer coursemology questions (practical),
2. studying the lecture topics that are not related to coursemology questions (theory),
3. working on the individual project.
Personally, I found it time-consuming to complete all of these 3 tasks in a week. Currently, I am behind on the individual project. This week is Week 5 but I have yet to complete the parts for Week 4 individual project. </markdown>

<box type="info" icon=":fas-comment:" light><span class="text-info"><markdown>Good breakdown. If pressed for time, you can give 2 a lower priority, but do try not to fall too far behind.

<markdown>The website is very very good, explains things in clear and concise way.

<markdown>I think everyone has their own speed, some are working adults, working as software engineer so it would be a breeze for them as they are already applying the concept from their daily work scope whereas some people are learning from the scratch. The instructions for Intellij is also not clear.</markdown>

<box type="info" icon=":fas-comment:" light><span class="text-info"><markdown>Yes, we do try to make the module flexible so that each student can learn at their own pace and learn as much as they want to e.g., we keep the project bar low but open ended.

As for Intellij, do check out the videos we have provided and let us know if you encounter problems. A bit of self-learning is required when it comes to things like IDEs as there are many and they evolve very fast.</markdown>

<box type="info" header="++My general responses for points raised multiple times++"
 icon=":fas-comment:" icon-size="2x" light >

Given below are some general responses to points you guys (and past students) raised multiple times:


* **Looking for more programming practice?**: I'm afraid I wont be able to add more exercises this time.
  Will consider adding more optional exercises next semester.
  In the meantime, you can get more programming practice by doing more in the project.
  You can refer to [Duke full description](https://nus-tic2002-2022.github.io/website/se-book-adapted/projectDuke/index.html) to find
  more things you can do with it.
* **Looking for more feedback on code written?**: Unlike lower-level programming modules, giving specific feedback
  on code written in an SE module takes a lot more expertise/effort, and such feedback is still rather subjective.
  We do not do that in any of our SE modules.
  Instead, we train students to slowly learn how to self-judge your own code.
  In addition, we'll be teaching you some code quality guidelines that you can apply to your code later.
