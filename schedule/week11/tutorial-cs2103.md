**A. One member do a quick demo of your v1.3 using the jar file** (preferably a different member from previous weeks):

**B. Whole team: do this question together, using the whiteboard**

<div class="indented">
  <include src="../../book/testCaseDesign/combiningTestInputs/mix/q-testCasesForConsumeMethod.md" />
</div>
<br>

**C. Divide these questions among team members and get ready to answer them.**

1. Distinguish between _sequential_ and _iterative_ processes. Which one are we using in the project?
1. Distinguish between _breadth-first_ and _depth-first_ iterative processes using your project as an example.
1. Describe how _agile process models_ differ from traditional process models.
1. When do you use _MVC_ pattern? Do we have MVC in AB3?

**D. Divide XP and Scrum between the two teams** for the following activity, if there is enough time left.

* Each team use the Web to find about 5 distinguishing features of the process model.
  * Some interesting [SCRUM concepts](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-scrum): Product backlog, scrum board, story points, burndown charts, scrum master, product owner
  * XP rules are described at [http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules.html](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules.html)

* Relate those features to your project. %%i.e. are they applicable? are you doing something similar?%%

1. What are the EPs for the parameter `day` of this method
   ```java
   /**
    * Returns true if the three values represent a valid day
    */
   boolean isValidDay(int year, int month, int day){
   
   } 
   ```
1. What are the boundary values for the parameter `day` in the question above?
1. Whatâ€™s the purpose of logging levels? What are the available logging levels in AB3?
1. Demonstrate an assertion failure using Intellij.
